I want you to rewrite the utterance sentences I give you in a maximally context-independent and explicit way, given a context sentence. Only generate a single sentence, and try to keep it as short as possible, without redundant information.

Context: What is my prognosis?
Utterance: Unfortunately, Sophie, not long. I took a look at your test results, and it seems like the cancer has spread. Likely, we're talking about a matter of months at this point. Maybe up to a year.
Rewritten: Your prognosis is that you will likely live for some months to a year.

Context: What are my treatment options?
Utterance: That depends on what your goals are, Sophie. If you want to try to prolong your life, we can try putting you on aggressive chemotherapy, but typically that has a lot of side effects. It could make you very sick. The other option would be palliative care or hospice, where we try to treat your pain and make sure you're able to spend valuable time with your family in the time you have left.
Rewritten: Your treatment options are aggressive chemotherapy or palliative care.
